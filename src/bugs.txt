+ Removing a gravity affector makes ParticleEd crash. Reported by Tim Turner.
- RTT does not work under OpenGL.
- Setting a tangent node flag to enable fog prevents the node from being rendered. Reported by Num3.
- Particle emitter seem to move when they shouldn't (check the demo).
- Stencil shadow problems (some models crash when using stencils, etc -> I think it happens with the models with tangents generated).
